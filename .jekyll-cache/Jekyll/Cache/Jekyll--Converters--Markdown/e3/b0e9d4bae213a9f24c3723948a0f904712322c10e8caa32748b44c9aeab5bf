I"Ö<p>Ms in Computer Science, software engineer and entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Within tech, Iâ€™m mostly interested in back-end web development, artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship.
Outside it, I make music, play football and am avidly into the oddly specific genre of English Language XIX Century literature. Currently based in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/R1X5iSVpRgEjCULG6">Buenos Aires, Argentina</a>.</p>

<p>I obtained my MS in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.uba.ar/internacionales/contenido.php?id=455&amp;lang=en">Univerity of Buenos Aires (UBA)</a>. Having developed a strong interest in AI and Computer Vision in particular, I enrolled in a research internship with the <a href="https://grupivis.dc.uba.ar/">Computer Vision and Image Processing Research Group (GRUPIVIS)</a> of my schoolâ€™s Computer Science Department. In my work with this group I also completed my <a href="http://gestion.dc.uba.ar/media/academic/grade/thesis/tesisLic_ShaiBianchi.pdf">MS thesis</a>, presenting a novel comparative analysis of particular implicit 3D surface reconstruction algorithms and deriving a new one with interesting properties. I also worked on several other AI and computer vision projects during those years, including a <a href="https://github.com/shaiperson/thumberemin">hand-tracking-based musical instrument</a> and a <a href="https://www-2.dc.uba.ar/trabajosFinalesOrga2/#2017_BIANCHI">dramatically optimized version of its core tracking algorithm</a> (see <em>Shai Bianchi</em> entry) using x86 Assembly SIMD instructions.</p>

<p>Following graduation, with my keenness for AI and entrepreneurship, I naturally gravitated towards working in startups that were taking on challenging AI-based projects. After a few years of doing that, I felt that time was ripe for me to take on the challenge myself in carrying out exciting ideas Iâ€™ve developed over the years and taking them to market. Having left my last full-time job, Iâ€™m currently dabbling in freelancing and developing MVPs for those ideas. So far, this has materialized in <em><a href="https://www.gopalanca.com">Palanca</a></em> where, alongisde my Co-Founder, weâ€™re leveraging our own experience in working in AI and ML to develop ML Ops solutions for companies.</p>
