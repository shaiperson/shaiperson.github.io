Ms in Computer Science, software engineer and entrepreneur.

Within tech, I'm mostly interested in back-end web development, artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship.
Outside it, I make music, play football and am avidly into the oddly specific genre of English Language XIX Century literature. Currently based in [Buenos Aires, Argentina](https://goo.gl/maps/R1X5iSVpRgEjCULG6).

I obtained my MS in Computer Science from the [Univerity of Buenos Aires (UBA)](https://www.uba.ar/internacionales/contenido.php?id=455&lang=en). Having developed a strong interest in AI and Computer Vision in particular, I enrolled in a research internship with the [Computer Vision and Image Processing Research Group (GRUPIVIS)](https://grupivis.dc.uba.ar/) of my school's Computer Science Department. In my work with this group I also completed my [MS thesis](http://gestion.dc.uba.ar/media/academic/grade/thesis/tesisLic_ShaiBianchi.pdf), presenting a novel comparative analysis of particular implicit 3D surface reconstruction algorithms and deriving a new one with interesting properties. I also worked on several other AI and computer vision projects during those years, including a [hand-tracking-based musical instrument](https://github.com/shaiperson/thumberemin) and a [dramatically optimized version of its core tracking algorithm](https://www-2.dc.uba.ar/trabajosFinalesOrga2/#2017_BIANCHI) (see _Shai Bianchi_ entry) using x86 Assembly SIMD instructions.

Following graduation, with my keenness for AI and entrepreneurship, I naturally gravitated towards working in startups that were taking on challenging AI-based projects. After a few years, I felt that the time was ripe for me to take on the challenge myself in carrying out exciting ideas I've developed over the years and taking them to market. Having left my previous full-time job, I'm currently dabbling in freelancing and developing MVPs for those ideas. So far, this has taken material shape in _[Palanca](https://www.gopalanca.com)_ where, alongisde my Co-Founder, we're leveraging our own experience in working in AI and ML to develop ML Ops solutions for companies.
