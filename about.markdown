Within tech, I'm mostly interested AI engineering, back-end development and entrepreneurship.
Outside it I enjoy making music and writing and am avidly into the curiously specific genre of English Language XIX Century literature. Currently based in [Buenos Aires, Argentina](https://goo.gl/maps/R1X5iSVpRgEjCULG6).

I obtained my MS in Computer Science from the [Univerity of Buenos Aires (UBA)](https://www.uba.ar/internacionales/contenido.php?id=455&lang=en). Having developed a strong interest in AI and Computer Vision in particular, I enrolled in a research internship with the [Computer Vision and Image Processing Research Group (GRUPIVIS)](https://grupivis.dc.uba.ar/) of my school's Computer Science Department. In my work with this group I also completed my [MS thesis](http://gestion.dc.uba.ar/media/academic/grade/thesis/tesisLic_ShaiBianchi.pdf), presenting a novel comparative analysis of implicit 3D surface reconstruction algorithms and deriving a new one with interesting properties. I also worked on several other AI and computer vision projects during those years, including a [hand-tracking-based musical instrument](https://github.com/shaiperson/thumberemin) and a [dramatically optimized version of its core tracking algorithm](https://www-2.dc.uba.ar/trabajosFinalesOrga2/#2017_BIANCHI) (see _Shai Bianchi_ entry) using x86 Assembly SIMD instructions.

Following graduation, I gravitated towards working in startups that were taking on challenging AI-based projects and worked in a few of them covering different industries and AI or AI-related technologies including rule-based AI algorithms, computer vision and ML Ops.
